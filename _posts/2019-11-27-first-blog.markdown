Translink planned a 3 day strike from Wednesday to Friday if proposed deal was not met by today.

The Student Union Building tried to come up with solutions for this by letting students stay in the building overnight. 

For me, my professors had luckily canceled classes for the three day strike. 

However, [last-minute deal averts Metro Vancouver transit system shutdown][news] after negotiating for 10 hours yesterday.

They came to an agreement today at 12:30 a.m.

Now I have to go back to school..:(
